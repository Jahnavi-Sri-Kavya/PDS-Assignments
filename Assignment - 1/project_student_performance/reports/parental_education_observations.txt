Observations on the Relationship Between Parental Education Levels and Student Scores:

1. Parents with a master's degree:
  - Their children tend to have the highest scores (70 and above) in math, reading, and writing.
  - This observation is consistent across all three subjects.

2. Parents with a high school education:
  - Their children tend to have the least scores across math, reading, and writing.
  - The scores are notably lower compared to other parental education levels.

These findings suggest a positive correlation between the level of parental education and the academic performance of students. Higher parental education levels, especially having a master's degree, appear to be associated with higher student scores, while lower education levels, such as having only a high school education, are associated with lower scores.
